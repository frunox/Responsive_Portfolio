# Responsive_Portfolio
*Created 2/29/20 by John Cannon*

This project involves the creation of a personal portfolio page using Bootstrap.  Goals for the project are:

1.  Use Bootstrap to create a navbar.
2.  Make the layout responsive to different device types.
3.  Make any images responsive, also.

### Minimum Requirements
* Functional, deployed application
* GitHub repository with README describing the project

The Bootstrap grid system is used to create the layout of the content of the pages.

In addition, two @media queries are included. One changes the background of the navbar at screen sizes of 767px and lower.  The second makes the content extend the entire width of the screen at 576px and lower.

## Notes for this commit:
1.  A sticky-footer was added to each page using Bootstrap, including .css styling.
2.  The navbar is fixed to the top of each page by adding the 'fixed-top' class.

Addtional minor changes to the initial code include re-ordering of the links in the navbar, and some changes to the colors in the navbar and footer.
