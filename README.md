# Responsive_Portfolio
*Updated 3/03/20 for final submittal by John Cannon*

This project involves the creation of a personal portfolio page using Bootstrap.  Goals for the project are:

1.  Use Bootstrap to create a navbar.
2.  Make the layout responsive to different device types.
3.  Make any images responsive, also.

### Minimum Requirements
* Functional, deployed application
* GitHub repository with README describing the project

The Bootstrap grid system is used to create the layout of the content of the pages.

In addition, two @media queries are included. One makes the content extend the entire width of the screen at 576px and lower.  THe second changes the background of the navbar at screen sizes of 767px and lower.  The second serves no purpose other than to show how @media queries can be used and will be deleted as this project progresses.

## Notes on personal touches:
1.  A sticky-footer was added to each page using Bootstrap, including .css styling.
2.  The navbar is fixed to the top of each page by adding the 'fixed-top' class.
3.  Minor changes to the initial code include re-ordering of the links in the navbar.
4.  The color scheme was changed, including the backgrounds for the navbar and the content.
5.  New pictures were added.
6.  The borders around some of the rows and columns are there to help see how the Bootstrap elements are laid out.  Some changes, mainly to the 'p' elements were made to align them in a more visually pleasing manner.
7.  A carousel was added in 'contact.html'.  This may be added in the future.
